My research primary focuses on the affective, cognitive, and behavioral implications of complex contexts, such as those involving changes, ongoing events, or unexpected occurrences. 

A great deal of my research falls into two (related yet distinct) streams. First, I am intrigued by individual responses to externally driven complexity, such as those created by changes in circumstances or underlying temporal patterns. Second, I am interested in internally driven complexity, such as those created by individual expectations of what the workplace will (or should) be.
